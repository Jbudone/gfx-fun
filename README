   GFX Fun!

=============
  Description

    A simple graphics project; used as an excuse to learn and work with opengl
	and various graphics theory techniques, as well as various game or graphics 
	related techniques (eg. data structures, storing map files, importing and
	exporting models). This project is meant as nothing more than a learning
	experience, as well as a portfolio item to show off my skills.
